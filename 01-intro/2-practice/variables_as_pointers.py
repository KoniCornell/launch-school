'''
In Python, all variables are pointers to objects. 
If you assign the same object to multiple variables, 
every one of those variables references (points to) the same object. 
They act like aliases for the object.

####

When you reassign a variable, Python changes what object the variable references. 
Reassignment doesn't alter the old or new object;
it simply changes which object the variable references.
