Why go through the setter?

Using self.name = name:

1. Triggers the @name.setter, which may include:
    - Validation (e.g., making sure the name isn't empty).
    - Logging.
    - Transformation (e.g., capitalizing the name).

2. Keeps behavior consistent across the class, so all changes to name go through 
    the same logic.

Using self._name = name:
    - Bypasses the setter completely.
    - Might be used in rare cases where you're sure you donâ€™t need validation 
        (e.g., during internal setup).
