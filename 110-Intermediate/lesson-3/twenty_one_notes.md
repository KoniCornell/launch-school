Twenty One

PEDAC

Deck:
- 52-card deck
- 4 suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades)
    >  2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (values are same)
    >  Jack: 10
    >  Queen: 10
    >  King: 10
    >  Ace : 1 or 11 * Depends on circumstances

    Notes on Ace value:
    - Its value is determined each time a new card is drawn 
    from the deck. 
    - For example, if the hand contains a 2, an Ace, and a 5, 
    then the total value of the hand is 18. Here the value of the 
    ace is 11 since the sum of the cards in hand is less than 21.
    - If another card is drawn and it happens to be an ace, the ace's 
    value needs to be recalculated since (2 + 11 + 5 + 11 > 21). Here, 
    one of the aces must be worth 1.



Goal:
- Get as close to 21 as possible without going over
- If you go over 21, it's `bust` and you lose

Setup:
- 2 players: Dealer and Player
- Each are initially dealt a hand of two cards
- The player can see their two cards but only one of the 
  dealer's cards.

Playing:
- Player always goes first
    > Decides whether to hit or stay
    > Hit means the player wants to be dealt another card
    > Stay 
    > If their total exceeds 21, they `bust` and lose the game
    > Turn is over if the player either busts or stays.
    > If the player busts, the game is over, and the dealer won.
- Dealer's Turn:
    > Happens when the player stays
    > Must follow strict rule for determining whether to hit or stay
        1. Hit until the total is >= 17 (atleast 17)
    > If the dealer busts, then the player wins.

-  Both player and dealer stay:
    > Compare the total value of the cards
    > See who has the total value of the cards.
